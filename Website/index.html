      <h3>Sorrento by the Sea</h3>
      <p>Sorrento by the Sea is in the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea.
          Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers restaurants, cafes, a chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet avenue, just 4 houses from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and surf.
          Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite overlooking a sun drenched, tree-filled private garden. 
          A separate kitchenette has everything you need to make your stay relaxed and comfortable. A queen sized bedroom and an amazing bathroom complete with free standing black bath entices you to relax and unwind. 
          Two TVs are sure to make everyone happy!  An undercover BBQ area with seating offers plenty of space to stretch out and enjoy that cup of freshly brewed coffee or a glass of wine.
          This is the perfect place for a home away from home.

    <h3>Pet friendly</h3>
  </div> 
  <div class ="pettext">
    <p1>
      We understand that pets are an important part of the family.
We are pet friendly by arrangement - so please talk to us about your needs.
We offer a fully enclosed backyard, shady trees, water bowls, food bowls and a lead if you forget one.
Only 3 minutes from a leash free beach, an oval close by and if you want to sleep in we are happy to take your dog (depending on its size) for a walk in the morning.
